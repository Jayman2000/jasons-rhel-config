# This section is intentionally left empty. In general, itâ€™s not a very
# good idea to depend on the %packages section to install packages.
# Adding packages to %packages is easy, but the only way to make sure
# that a system actually has those packages installed is to reinstall
# the system.
#
# In fact, I would prefer to not include a packages section at all, but
# Anaconda aborts the installation if you do that.
